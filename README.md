The “Ray Tracing” method, developed for the first time in 1968 (but improved upon since) is even today more expensive in computation than the “Rasterization” method.
  A ray-tracing project implemented on CPU. Allows you to generate scenes in 3D containing objects. Each scene can be be viewed by a set of cameras characterized by its position, direction and Field Of View (FOV). This project can be used only with Minilibx so it can work only on macOS.
